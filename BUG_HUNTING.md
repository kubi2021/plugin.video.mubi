# Bug Hunting Policy

## Bug Hunting Level

This Kodi plugin implements **Level 2 (User Experience Focus)** bug hunting, which provides optimal reliability for media consumption applications while maintaining development efficiency.

## Bug Hunting Framework

### Level 2 (User Experience Focus) - Current Implementation

**Scope**: Focus on user-facing scenarios and common edge cases that affect media consumption experience.

#### What Level 2 Bug Hunting Covers:
- ✅ **Media playback reliability** - Videos start, play, and complete successfully
- ✅ **Library sync consistency** - Films appear correctly, no duplicates, proper metadata
- ✅ **Network error handling** - Graceful degradation when MUBI API is unavailable
- ✅ **File system operations** - Safe file creation, proper cleanup, cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ **User interface responsiveness** - No freezing, proper loading indicators, error messages
- ✅ **Configuration edge cases** - Invalid settings, missing credentials, corrupted data
- ✅ **API error scenarios** - Rate limiting, authentication failures, malformed responses
- ✅ **Data consistency** - Proper state management, no corrupted metadata

#### Bug Categories Prioritized in Level 2:

**High Priority (User-Blocking):**
- Crashes that prevent plugin startup
- Complete failure to play any videos
- Library sync failures that leave empty library
- Authentication loops that prevent access
- File system errors that corrupt user data

**Medium Priority (User-Frustrating):**
- Intermittent playback failures
- Slow or unresponsive UI
- Incorrect metadata display
- Partial sync failures
- Poor error messages

**Low Priority (Edge Cases):**
- Rare configuration combinations
- Non-critical performance issues
- Cosmetic UI glitches
- Theoretical race conditions

#### What Level 2 Does NOT Over-Focus On:
- ❌ **Extreme performance optimization** - Micro-second improvements
- ❌ **Complex concurrency scenarios** - Theoretical thread safety issues
- ❌ **Memory micro-management** - Minor memory leaks in short-lived processes
- ❌ **Theoretical edge cases** - Scenarios that never occur in real usage

## Bug Hunting Methodology

### 1. Intent and User Flow Analysis
**Primary User Flows:**
- Install plugin → Configure credentials → Browse films → Play video
- Sync library → Browse local collection → Play from library
- Search for specific film → Play directly
- Update library → Verify new content appears

### 2. Implicit Assumptions Identification
**Common Assumptions to Validate:**
- Network connectivity is available
- MUBI API returns expected data formats
- File system has write permissions
- Kodi provides expected callback responses
- User credentials remain valid
- Metadata fields contain expected data types

### 3. Systematic Edge Case Categories

#### Data Type & Format Issues:
- `None` values in required fields
- Empty strings vs. missing keys
- Integer vs. string type mismatches
- Malformed JSON responses
- Unicode characters in titles
- Very long strings exceeding limits

#### Boundary Violations:
- Empty film libraries
- Single-film libraries
- Libraries with thousands of films
- Network timeouts (short and long)
- Disk space exhaustion
- Invalid date formats

#### Logic & State Corruption:
- Multiple sync operations running simultaneously
- Interrupted sync operations
- Corrupted configuration files
- Invalid authentication states
- Partial file writes
- Cache inconsistencies

#### User Interface Edge Cases:
- Rapid user interactions
- Navigation during loading
- Back button during operations
- Settings changes during sync
- Plugin disable/enable cycles

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### Automated Testing:
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Error injection tests
- Boundary condition tests

#### Manual Testing Scenarios:
- Fresh installation workflow
- Network interruption during sync
- Invalid credentials handling
- Large library performance
- Cross-platform compatibility



## Testing Environments

### Required Test Scenarios:
- **Fresh Installation**: Clean Kodi with no existing data
- **Existing Installation**: Upgrade from previous plugin version
- **Network Variations**: Fast, slow, intermittent, offline
- **Library Sizes**: Empty, small (1-10), medium (50-100), large (500+)
- **Platform Testing**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Apple TV

### Test Data Requirements:
- Valid MUBI credentials
- Invalid/expired credentials
- Films with various metadata completeness
- Films with special characters in titles
- Films with missing artwork
- Very long film titles and descriptions
